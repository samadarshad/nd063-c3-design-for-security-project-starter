# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
1) Reducing SSH login access
- Deploy Immutable Instances so that there is no need to login to the instance
- If not possible, change SSH login to be done via AWS Systems Manager so there is no internet exposure required, nor passwords/private keys managed for the instance.
2) Reducing internet access
- Move Web server to a private subnet, with a Network ACL that only allows traffic from the Load Balancer
- Or update web server security group to only allow traffic from the load Balancer
3) Reducing attack traffic
- Add AWS Web Application Firewall to the Load Balancer which will protect the load balancer from common exploits


# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
Moving the S3 endpoint to a private subnet will only prevent access from outside the VPC.
Therefore, as the IAM permissions are unsecure, there is still possibility of unauthorized access to the VPC, and thus unauthorized access to S3. 

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
Existing objects will not get re-encrypted with the new encryption settings.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
The security hardening changes would be reverted, therefore the web server would be exposed again to all the original security risks.
