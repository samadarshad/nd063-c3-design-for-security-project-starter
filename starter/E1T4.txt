Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

The threats to the secret recipes are:
- the web server is accessed by a malicious user
- a malicious user pretends to be a priviledged business user  
- the s3 bucket for secret recipes is accessed by a malicious user

# Poor practice 1
The Web Server is a exposed because:
- the server is placed in a public subnet, thus having a public IP and exposed.
- the server is within a security group that allows all inbound access and outbound access.
- the public load balancer is within a security group that allows all outbound access i.e. ssh to the web server
The Web Server is a risk because:
- the server has role policy privilidges that allows full access to the s3 bucket of secret recipes


# Poor practice 2
The priviledged business use-case API is exposed because:
- there is no authentication for the business users
This API is a risk because:
- the API have full access to the s3 bucket of secret recipes


# Poor practice 3
The s3 bucket for secret recipes is exposed because:
- the bucket allows all public access i.e. the objects have a publically accessible url
The s3 bucket for secret recipes is a risk because:
- the recipes have no custom key encryption
